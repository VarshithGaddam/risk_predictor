# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A simple yet innovative healthcare analytics platform that demonstrates the power of AI-driven insights for patient care. This hackathon prototype focuses on three core innovations: (1) Smart patient risk prediction using ML, (2) Real-time visual analytics dashboard, and (3) AI-powered clinical note analysis. The goal is to show how modern data science can transform healthcare decision-making with a working prototype.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Patient Risk Prediction

**User Story:** As a clinician, I want to see which patients are at risk of readmission, so that I can prioritize interventions and prevent complications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN patient data is uploaded to the system THEN the ML model SHALL analyze vital signs, diagnosis, and treatment history to generate a risk score (0-100)
2. WHEN a risk score is calculated THEN the system SHALL display the top 3 contributing risk factors in plain language
3. WHEN a patient's risk score exceeds 70 THEN the system SHALL flag them as "High Risk" with a red indicator
4. WHEN the risk assessment is displayed THEN the system SHALL show confidence level and suggest specific preventive actions
5. WHEN new patient data is added THEN the system SHALL recalculate risk scores automatically

### Requirement 2: Interactive Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want to visualize key metrics at a glance, so that I can quickly understand hospital performance and patient trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display 4 key metrics: total patients, high-risk patients, average length of stay, and readmission rate
2. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL use color-coded cards (green for good, yellow for warning, red for critical)
3. WHEN a user clicks on a metric card THEN the system SHALL show a detailed chart with historical trends
4. WHEN patient data changes THEN the dashboard SHALL update metrics within 5 seconds
5. WHEN the user views the patient list THEN the system SHALL allow sorting and filtering by risk level, admission date, and diagnosis

### Requirement 3: AI Clinical Note Analyzer

**User Story:** As a doctor, I want to quickly extract key information from clinical notes, so that I can save time and focus on patient care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a clinical note is entered THEN the AI SHALL extract symptoms, diagnoses, medications, and procedures automatically
2. WHEN entities are extracted THEN the system SHALL highlight them with different colors (symptoms in blue, diagnoses in red, medications in green)
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a structured summary with bullet points
4. WHEN multiple notes exist for a patient THEN the system SHALL show a timeline view of extracted information
5. WHEN the AI is uncertain about an extraction THEN the system SHALL mark it with a confidence score below 80%

### Requirement 4: Simple Data Upload and Management

**User Story:** As a demo user, I want to easily upload sample patient data, so that I can test the system without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the upload page THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with patient records
2. WHEN a CSV is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (patient ID, age, diagnosis, vitals) and show errors if missing
3. WHEN data is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation with the number of records processed
4. WHEN sample data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Load Demo Data" button that populates the system with 50 realistic patient records
5. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL store it in a local database for the demo session

### Requirement 5: Clean and Modern UI

**User Story:** As any user, I want a beautiful and intuitive interface, so that the platform feels professional and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a modern navigation bar with clear menu items
2. WHEN pages are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme throughout
3. WHEN the user navigates between pages THEN transitions SHALL be smooth without page reloads
4. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to provide feedback
5. WHEN the app is viewed on mobile THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and usable on smaller screens
